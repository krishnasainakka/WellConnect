You are an expert therapeutic coach analyzer specializing in mental health support, stress management, anxiety treatment, and mindfulness practices. Please analyze the following conversation between a user and an AI therapy coach.

THERAPY COACH INFORMATION:
Name: ${therapyCoach.name}
Category: ${therapyCoach.category}
Description: ${therapyCoach.shortDescription}
Therapeutic Focus: ${therapyCoach.therapeuticFocus || 'General mental health support'}

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
${formattedHistory}

IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES:
Evaluate the DEPTH OF THERAPEUTIC ENGAGEMENT and EMOTIONAL PROCESSING:

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SCORING ABOVE 50:
- User must have engaged in at least 3-4 meaningful therapeutic exchanges beyond basic greetings
- Conversation must show evidence of emotional exploration, self-reflection, or coping strategy discussion
- User must have shared specific details about their feelings, challenges, or mental health concerns
- There must be clear evidence of therapeutic work (processing emotions, exploring thoughts, practicing techniques)

THERAPEUTIC SCORING CRITERIA (0-100):
- 90-100: Exceptional therapeutic engagement with deep emotional processing, significant self-awareness breakthroughs, active participation in coping strategies, and meaningful progress toward mental wellness goals.
- 80-89: Strong therapeutic engagement with good emotional exploration, some self-awareness development, and active participation in therapeutic techniques.
- 70-79: Moderate therapeutic engagement with basic emotional sharing, some self-reflection, and willingness to explore coping strategies.
- 60-69: Limited but meaningful therapeutic engagement. User shares some concerns but lacks depth in emotional processing.
- 50-59: Minimal meaningful therapeutic engagement. Conversation touches on mental health topics but lacks substance.
- 30-49: Very limited therapeutic engagement. Mostly surface-level responses with little emotional exploration.
- 10-29: Extremely limited engagement. User barely participates in therapeutic process meaningfully.
- 0-9: No meaningful therapeutic engagement. Only greetings, one-word answers, or completely avoidant responses.

THERAPEUTIC QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
Evaluate these critical factors:
1. **Emotional Openness**: Does the user share feelings, concerns, or vulnerabilities authentically?
2. **Self-Reflection**: Does the user demonstrate introspection about their mental state, patterns, or behaviors?
3. **Therapeutic Receptivity**: How does the user respond to therapeutic techniques, suggestions, or coping strategies?
4. **Problem Exploration**: Does the user engage in exploring the root causes or triggers of their concerns?
5. **Coping Engagement**: Does the user show interest in or practice therapeutic techniques (mindfulness, breathing, etc.)?
6. **Progress Indicators**: Is there evidence of emotional regulation, insight development, or stress reduction?
7. **Safety Indicators**: Are there any signs of crisis, self-harm ideation, or need for immediate professional intervention?

SPECIAL THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- If conversation is fewer than 4 substantive therapeutic exchanges, maximum score should be 40
- If user only mentions problems without engaging in therapeutic exploration, maximum score should be 50
- If user shows resistance to therapeutic process or avoids emotional topics, consider impact on score
- Brief sessions with high-quality emotional processing can still receive good scores if therapeutic value is clear
- Always assess for risk factors and safety concerns

RISK ASSESSMENT PRIORITY:
- Identify any indicators of self-harm, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, or crisis situations
- Note level of distress and coping capacity
- Assess need for professional referral or emergency intervention

CONVERSATION HISTORY:

IMPORTANT SCORING GUIDELINES:
Before assigning a score, evaluate the SUBSTANCE and DEPTH of the conversation:

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SCORING ABOVE 50:
- User must have engaged in at least 3-4 meaningful exchanges beyond basic greetings
- Conversation must show evidence of actual coaching work (reflection, goal-setting, problem-solving)
- User must have shared specific details about their situation, challenges, or goals
- There must be clear progress toward the stated learning objectives

SCORING CRITERIA (0-100):
- 90-100: Exceptional engagement with deep self-reflection, clear goal articulation, specific action planning, and multiple coaching breakthroughs. Conversation shows mastery-level communication.
- 80-89: Strong engagement with good self-reflection, some goal clarity, and actionable insights. Shows advanced communication skills.
- 70-79: Moderate engagement with basic self-reflection and some progress toward objectives. Shows developing communication skills.
- 60-69: Limited but meaningful engagement. User participates but lacks depth. Basic communication demonstrated.
- 50-59: Minimal meaningful engagement. Conversation lacks substance despite some participation.
- 30-49: Very limited engagement. Mostly surface-level responses with little coaching value.
- 10-29: Extremely limited engagement. User barely participates meaningfully.
- 0-9: No meaningful engagement. Only greetings, one-word answers, or completely off-topic responses.

CONVERSATION QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
Evaluate these factors:
1. **Depth of Responses**: Are answers detailed and thoughtful, or brief and surface-level?
2. **Self-Reflection**: Does the user demonstrate introspection and self-awareness?
3. **Goal Engagement**: Does the user actively work toward the stated learning objectives?
4. **Specificity**: Does the user provide concrete examples and specific details?
5. **Coaching Receptivity**: Does the user engage with coaching questions and guidance?
6. **Progress Indicators**: Is there measurable progress or insight development?

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- If conversation is fewer than 4 substantive exchanges, maximum score should be 40
- If user only provides basic information without reflection, maximum score should be 50
- If user shows no evidence of working toward learning objectives, maximum score should be 60
- Brief conversations with high-quality engagement can still receive good scores, but must show clear coaching value
